## INSTALL

You should have a modern version of Perl (5.2x would be nice, but even 5.8 will work).  If you have
a dependency resolver like carton, you should be able to pull in all you need by changing to the
desktop_cheerlights directory and typing 'carton'.  This should install whatever modules you are
missing.  Then, simply run: 'perl desktop_cheerlights.pl'

Pass the '-h' switch on the command line to desktop_cheerlights.pl to see what visualization options
are available.
